ORBIT Changelog
===============

Unreleased (TBD)
----------------

Merged SemiTaut Moorings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``MooringSystemDesign`` module now can use a Catenary or SemiTaut mooring system. User can specify "mooring_type".
- The ``FloatingOffshoreSubstation`` and ``ElectricalDesign`` modules now actually have a floating option to remove any substructure mass (and cost) from older versions. User can specify "oss_substructure_type"
- The ``MoredSubInstallation`` now utilizes an AHTS vessel which must be added to any config file as (ahts_vessel)
- "drag_embedment_install_time" increased from 5 to 12 hours
- quayside turbine tower section lift time from 12 to 4 hours per section. User specifies number of sections (default =1)
- quayside nacelle lift time changed from 7 to 12 hours
- XLPE_500mm_132kV cost_per_km changed from 200k to 500k
- example_cable_lay_vessel min_draft changed from 4.8m to 8.5m, overall_length 99m to 171m, max_mass 4000t to 13000t
- example_towing_vessel max_waveheight changed from 2.5m to 3.0m, max_windspeed 20m to 15m, transit_speed 6km/h to 14 km/h, day_rate 30k to 35k

Merged Electrical Refactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated ``ElectricalDesign`` module.
This class combines the elements of ``ExportSystemDesign`` and the ``OffshoreSubstationDesign`` modules. Its purpose is to represent the export system more accurately
by linking the type of cable (AC versus DC) and substation’s components (i.e. transformers versus converters).Figure 1 shows how to add ElectricalDesign() to a yaml
configuration file. Most export and substation component costs were updated to include a per-unit cost rather than a per-MW cost rate and they can be added to the
yaml file as arguments too. Otherwise, those per-unit costs use default and were determined with the help of a subcontractor.
    - This module’s components’ cost scales with number of cables and substations rather than plant capacity.
    - The offshore substation cost is calculated based on the cable type and number of cables, rather than scaling function based on plant capacity.
    - The mass of an HVDC and HVAC substation are assumed to be the same. Without any new information the substructure mass and cost functions did not change.
    - An experimental onshore cost function was also added to account for the duplicated interconnection components. Costs will vary depending on the cable type.

Figure 1: Adding the new ElectricalDesign class to design phase in the yaml configuration file (left) versus using the original ExportDesignSystem and
OffshoreSubstationDesign classes (right). Note: ORBIT will not override output values from a design phase, so it will use the first instance and ignore
any subsequent designs that produce the same outputs.

- Added an example notebook: `Example - Using HVDC or HVAC`
This new example showcases the capabilities of the ``ElectricalDesign`` class. It demonstrates how to create projects using HVAC or HVDC cables and
how to use ParametricManager to compare the two design decisions.

- Expanded tests to demonstrate new features in ``ElectricalDesign``.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fully adopted `pyproject.toml` for managing all possible tool settings, and
  removed the tool-specific files from the top-level of the directory.
- Replaced flake8 and pylint with ruff to adopt a cleaner, faster, and easier
  to manage linting and autoformatting workflow. As a result, some of the more
  onerous checks have been removed to discourage the use of
  `git commit --no-verify`. This change has also added in other rules that
  discourage Python anti-patterns and encourage modern Python usage.
- NOTE: Users may wish to run
  `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs` to ignore the
  reformatting edits in their blame.
